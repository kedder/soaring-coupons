Soaring Coupons is a basic application that is capable of organizing sales of
pre-defined items through mokejimai.lt payment provider.

## Running

Simplest way to run the app is to use [docker](https://www.docker.com/) and
[docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/). In order to start the app,
copy `env.sample` file into `env` and edit it to provide necessary
configuration. Then do:

```sh
docker-compose up
```

The app should be available on http://localhost:8080. Django admin is available
under `/dbadmin` url.


## Developing

Few hints for my future self.

### Database migrations

After changes to data schemas, migrations has to be generated and applied:

```
./manage.py makemigrations
./manage.py migrate
```

See https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.0/topics/migrations/ for more info.

### Deploying to dokku

Whenever new version is complete, push it to dokku:

```
git push dokku master
```
